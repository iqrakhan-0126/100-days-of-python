#Subscripting


# print('Hellow'[-2]) #this method is called subscripting where we can get the specific letter from the string using its index number.

#String 
# print('123' + '456') #this will concatenate the two strings and give output as 123456

#Integer
# print(123 + 456) #this will add the two integers and give output as 579

#Large Integers
# print(123_456_789) #this is also an integer but we can use underscores to make it more readable. The output will be 123456789

#Float = Floting Point Number
# print(3.12345) #this is a float number which is a number with decimal point.

#Boolean
# print(True) #this is a boolean value which can be either True or False.
# print(False)

# street_name = "Abbey Road"
# print(street_name[4] + street_name[7])


# len('Hellow') 

# print(type(123))
# print(type('abc'))
# print(type(3.14))
# print(type(True))

# print(int('123') + int('456')) #this will convert the string '123' to integer 123


# num = input('Enter your name: ')
# number = len(num)


# print(type('Number of literals in your name: ')) 
# print(type(number))  
  

# print('Number of literals in your  name : ' + str(number))  #this will convert the integer number to string and concatenate it with the string 'Number of literals in your name: '



# num1 = input('Enter your name:- ')
# num2 = len(num1)

# print('Number of literals in your name is :' + str(num2))
